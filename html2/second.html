                    was started in 1994 in Coimbatore. In 2002, two additional Schools of Engineering were established in Amritapuri and Bengaluru.<br>
                    All three Schools offer B.Tech., M.Tech. and Ph.D. programs in a large number of disciplines.<br>
                    Outstanding students aspiring for careers in engineering, from across the country and abroad are enrolled in the three Schools. <br>
                    ASE has an excellent faculty student ratio which is well above the national norms.</p><br>

                        17 September 2006 — Amritapuri<br>
                        For a long time there was “sand seva.” Then, later it was “brick seva.” Now it is “bridge seva.”<br>
                        Towards the end of darshan on the 16th, Amma asked all the ashramites to come in the morning and help mix the concrete <br>
                        and pour the girders for the deck of the bridge connecting Alappad Panchayat with the mainland.<br>

                    <p> It was the first big cement structure to be built and took five years to finish <br>
                        from 1988 to 1992 as the financial means of the ashram were still very modest at the time.<br>
                         The Kali idol in the temple, was crafted in Calcutta as per Amma’s instructions. Mother Kali is the destroyer of the ego. </p><br>
